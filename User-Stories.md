## Effective User Stories

### Definitions

Sshort descriptions of a product enhancement (i.e., a product feature) expressed in a specific format. User Stories are simplified requirements

### User Story Format with Examples

> As a `the user role`, I want `the goal` so that `the rationale` 

- Example 01: As an *Open Source Enthusiast*, I want *to contribute into more repositories* so that *people get benefited in the process*
- Example 02: As a *Project Manager*, I want *to be able to understand my colleagues progress* so that *I can make efficient reports on sucess and failures*

### Characteristics of good user stories: The INVEST Model in Scrum

Coined by Bill Wake in his book `Extreme Programming Explored`, INVEST is an acronym that defines a simple set of rules used in creating well-formed user stories

>  A good story captures the essence, not the details.

by Bill Wake

1. Independent: Stories should not be dependent on other stories. No overlapping across one another in terms of functionality, ensures flexibility of working regardless of order
2. Negotiable: Stories should capture the essence of the requirement and should not represent a contract on how to solve it.
3. Valuable: Stories should clearly and perceivably illustrate value to the customer.
4. Estimable: Stories should provide just enough information so they can be estimated. However, it's not important to know the exact way that a particular problem will be solved. 
5. Small: Stories should strive to be concise, to be developed under a few days/weeks.
6. Testable: Stories need to be comprehensible to the point where tests can be defined.

### Epics VS User Stories

- Large user stories are called epics. Decomposing (or splitting) them into individual parts creates user stories.
- There is no point spending time on breaking down epics that are low priority. 

### The Big Three Question checklist for effectiveness

1. Immediately after reading the User Story is it obvious what the User Story is about?
2. Does each element of the User Story add significant value and therefore avoids duplication or partial duplication of other elements?
3. Is it totally 100% free of ‘the how’/the solution?
