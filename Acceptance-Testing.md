### The 3 Cs: Card, Conversation, Confirmation

- The Three Cs of Card, Conversation, Confirmation were suggested by Ron Jeffries in 2001.
- The most common way to specify what is required for *Confirmation* of your user stories is to create a set of acceptance tests for each user story.

### Format of a Rule/Test

> `GIVEN` > `WHEN` > `THEN` 

Example: If *user has no Internet connectivity* and *user attempts to view the updates*, then *a No Internet dialog should pop up*

| GIVEN      | WHEN          | THEN  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| user has no Internet connectivity | user attempts to view the updates | a No Internet dialog should pop up |
